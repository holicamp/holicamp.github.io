# Our approach

Back in 2016, we wanted to be able to offer a play scheme for children staying in London during school holidays.
Right from the start, we wanted it to be fun, using various games and sport activities but also to define clear
educational goals while aiming for high standards for our services.

This is how, our small team at Holicamp, including myself, Mr Blain, PE teacher at CFBL (Collège français
bilingue de Londres), have been working on putting together rich planning of activities for children
from 6 to 15 years old. We wanted to make sure core values (like respect, teamwork, confidence...)
were reflected in our activities while channelling everything through fun and well-being.

We hope you appreciate our approach and we will do everything we can so your little ones enjoy their Holicamp experience!

# What is the program?

Every morning we will be ready to welcome the participants at **10.00am** at our _collection point_ and
we will be finishing the day at around **3.15pm**. Find more information about dropping/collecting your kids
further down this page.

Every week our program is different and can be adjusted depending on various things like the weather,
the children, the attendance for example ; but here is a downloadable version of a typical program for
primary school children, take a peek!

For secondary school children, our camps are a bit more organised around sport activities like frisbee,
baseball, dodgeball, football or tennis while keeping core activities like yoga, fitness or orienteering too.

# Where is this happening?

## Outdoors! 🌤 🌳 🌲
## Hamsptead Heath

If the weather allows it, we prefer to set our camp outdoors, in Hamsptead Heath on Parliament Hill.

Our meeting point is just behind the Parliament Hill Lido swimming pool.

## What if it’s raining cats and dogs? 🌧 🏫 🐈🐩
## The Dome

In case of rain, we always have a backup plan and always book in advance
[The Dome](https://www.mylocalpitch.com/london/venue/the-dome), a sports complex offering good facilities
so we can still organise our activities indoors.

If the meeting point changes from outdoors to indoors during the day because of the weather, our staff
will make sure to let you know in advance so you are sure where to pick-up your children.

# What about lunch breaks? 🥪 🍎 🥤

Every day we'll have a half an hour lunch break between 12am - 12:30pm but unfortunately we don't
provide lunch yet. A cold packed lunch will have to be prepared by the family and brought to the camp.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# Do I need to drop and collect my kid(s)?

For **primary** school children, yes! For obvious security reasons, we require an adult to be mentioned
during each booking, including names and contact number, in order for our team to know who is responsible
to collect them after each camp. Similar to a check-in/check-out process, we will require a signature
from each adult dropping/collecting kids from the camp.

However, for **secondary** school children, we believe those teenagers are old enough to use public
transports and/or walk to and from the meeting point, every day. If you still prefer to drop and
collect them, this is absolutely fine too but we won't require personal details of the person who is
going to be responsible of this.

# How do I book online?

Simply visit [our booking page](/#booking) and select which week/camp you'd like to book for your children.
We'll go through all the nitty-gritty when completing the booking we are clear about who is coming,
the full week, only some days during the week and so on.

In order to ensure the best level of quality and to ensure health and safety to all our participants, we have decided to limit the number of seats for each week.
We also apply a "first come, first served" policy. You can book up to 4 children per booking.
Based on our staff, every camp is limited in terms of the maximum number of participants, so we can respect health and safety regulations.
